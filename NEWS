Again, this release is backward incompatible with previous libxr releases,
because of support for implicit string XML-RPC values.

- Support implicit string values in XML-RPC (thanks to David Lee).

- Updated docs.

0.9.90 - 2007-12-10 (1.0.0-rc1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note: This is source and binary incompatible release.

This release reveals the significance of 'x' in libxr. It does not stand for
XML, it stands for whatever you want (or more precisely, whatever you are
willing to implement).

- Added support for handling arbitrary uploads and downloads (GETs, POSTs). See
  __upload__ and __download__ hooks.
- Use buffered BIO and simplify/speedup HTTP code.
- Allow to use libxr from C++ code. (thanks to David Lee)
- Allow to set custom HTTP headers on xr_client_conn object.
- Implemented HTTP basic auth.
- Removed unused GLIB mainloop integration.
- Don't pretty print XML-RPC requests unless in XR_DEBUG_HTTP mode.
- Return boolean FALSE intead of -1 on errors in: xr_client_call,
  xr_client_open, xr_server_bind, xr_server_run, xr_server_register_servlet,
  xr_value_to_*
- Use transparent SSL DEFLATE compression when possible.
- Implemented copy functions for XDL_ARRAY and XDL_STRUCT types (in addition to
  existing *_new and *_free functions).
- Always return -1 error code on internal errors. (100 was returned before)
- Added support for multiple transport types. Server can handle multiple
  transports transparently based on Content-Type HTTP header.
- Implemented JSON-RPC transport. (application/json)
- Implemented server side 'session' support, so that servlet instance can be
  preserved across multiple connections. (for clients that do not support
  persistent connections.)
- Implemented Prototype based AJAX JSON-RPC client code generator.
- Implemented simple cURL based PHP JSON-RPC proxy.
- All g_assert() uses replaced with g_return_if_fail()
- Fixed #line 123 "(null)" bug in xdl-compiler.

There is still a possibility that libxr API will change slightly until 1.0.0 is
released.
